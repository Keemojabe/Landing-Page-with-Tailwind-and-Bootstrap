# Landing Pages Assignment

This repository contains two simple landing pages built as part of a school assignment:

- `tailwind-landing.html`: A modern landing page using Tailwind CSS
- `bootstrap-landing.html`: A responsive landing page using Bootstrap 5

Both pages include a navbar, hero section, and a call-to-action button.

Note: This project was fully created and submitted using only a smartphone and GitHub.
